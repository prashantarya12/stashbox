## Stashbox is your personal Internet Archive

The goal of stashbox is to help you create your own - personal copy of websites that you wish to archive.  

The initial way to do this will be to run a simple command, but in the future it can be extended to a web interface, a plugin or other means.

Having a local "static" copy of a website can help for research, change tracking and for many other purposes

## Roadmap

1. Initial command line client to add urls to a personal archive with Text, Html and Pdf copies of the website
2. Ability to save new versions of the same URL
3. Version "diffing" and browsing
4. User friendly interface (web, etc)
5. Searching and other functions
6. User requirnments
7. Latest updates for webpages to handle user inputs
8. Good contents for attractive to user
## Usage
```
 Usage of ./stashbox:
  -b string
    	folder to save stash into (default "./stashDb")
  -url string
    	url to download
```
